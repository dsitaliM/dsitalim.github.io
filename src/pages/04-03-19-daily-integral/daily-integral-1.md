Some time back I came across an Interesting story about Landau while reading Quanta Magazine. Landau once suffered a serious automobile accident that put in a comma for more than a month. So one day his son came to visit him and instead of exchanging compliments Landau asked him to find the indefinite integral of $dx$ over $sin(x)$.

<!-- excerpt: "Calculating Landau's Integral $sin(x)$ -->

$$
\int \frac{dx}{sin(x)}\,
$$
